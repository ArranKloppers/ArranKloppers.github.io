Welcome to my digital portfolio

This project is a personal portfolio website built to showcase my skills, projects, and experience as a final year BSc Information Technology student at North-West University. The site features an overview of my background, technical abilities, and selected work, and serves as a central point of contact for potential employers and collaborators.
